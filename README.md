# Competitive Programming Progress

Hi, I'm **Mohammad Sakib Biswas**.  
Currently, I am regularly solving **Codeforces** problems from the **TLE-Eliminator Sheet** to improve my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

---

## Goals
- Strengthen knowledge of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.
- Solve at least **5 problems daily** to maintain consistency.
- Focus on learning advanced **graph algorithms**, **dynamic programming**, and **greedy techniques**.
- Prepare for upcoming **competitive programming contests** on Codeforces, AtCoder, and LeetCode.

## My Profiles
- **Codeforces:** [https://codeforces.com/profile/your_username](https://codeforces.com/profile/ultimateboss)
- **LeetCode:** [https://leetcode.com/your_username/](https://leetcode.com/u/khudabox144/)

## Current Focus
- TLE-Eliminator problem sheet.
- Identifying weak areas and revising standard algorithms.
- Writing **clean, optimized C++ solutions** with detailed comments.

---

### How I Practice
- I start with easy/medium-level problems and gradually take on harder ones.
- I track my progress using spreadsheets and note down mistakes for revision.
- I participate in regular **Codeforces Div. 2 and Div. 3 contests**.
